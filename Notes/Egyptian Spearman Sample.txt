there are 5 animations.

the dps is 10.

each animation has 1.

so its 10 times (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1) / 5
equals 10 in this case.

has to see if i can find the fields to correspond.

i propose doing a list of int.


the animations this time are:
Animation1Hit1Durations
Animation2Hit1Durations
Animation3Durations
Animation4Durations
Animation5Durations
