1.  Uses a brand new file which are the upgrades.

some things are not needed

If Attack And Defense has no X then means do not include.

2.  fields to use

"Civ": "All",
    "Name": "BodkinArrows",
    "FromWhere": "Armory",
    "Attack": "X",
    "Defense": "",
"DamageMeleeinf": "",
    "Damagecavalry": "",
    "Damageranged": "0.2",
    "Damagesiegemeleeattack": "",
    "Damagesiegerangedattack": "",
    "Infantry": "",
    "Ranged": "",
    "Cavalry": "",
    "Building": "",
    "Ship": "",
    "Siege": "",
    "Priest": "",
    "Villager": "",
    "Sarissophoroi": "",
"Storehouse": "",
    "Hitpoints": "",
    "Infantry2": "",
    "Cavalry2": "",
    "Ranged2": "",
    "Siege5": "",
    "Bdp": "",
    "Attackspeed": ""

3.  good news is for part 1, its only use to calculate dps.

this means for this phase, the dps field is now different.

because we will have a base dps.
but it can be adjusted depending on various techs.

4.  for this phase, a person can choose any tech they want.


i could require a new control for choosing several items from a list.

i propose for this, will be a list of object.

however, will use renderfragment for the stuff before the checkbox.
if you click on either the checkbox or the render fragment itself, will check/uncheck it.

the unselect all or select all may be something else (will use bindings).



my impressions:

1.  the parts that would change is the dps has to have 2 different fields.
2.  the other field requires a list of techs (could use something else to reference it) (well see).
3.  could decide to do extensions for the model.

this way the model continues to do what it does best.
but then extensions are used for extras.

maybe required.
since dps has to be calculated (techs can influence it now).

4.  a brand new file this time (the other phases did not have that).

5.  lots of changes are needed to the results.
good thing that phase 4 was done.
so whatever i do here will not affect phase 4.
phase 4 was a foundation.
if phase 4 was not done, i would not had the foundation.
