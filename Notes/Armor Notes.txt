For armor, the types of armors provided are:
1.  hand
2.  Cavalry
3.  Ranged
4.  Siege

For armor, if the armor is 0, then means armor protection is 0.

I propose calculating the armor protection.

which gets subtracted from the dpa.

if 0, then means somehow no damage.


This requires an attacker and the defender.

the defender uses armor to take less damage.

the defender needs to know the type of the attacker.

for this part, there are 4 categories.

means a function is needed to calculate the AttackArmorCategory
