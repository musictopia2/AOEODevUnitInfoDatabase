Base DPA (which was already calculated earlier).

first minus the armor of the type (based on percentage).
if the armor was 1, then no damage obviously.

otherwise, very low damage.

after that we have the bonuses.

lets say the bonus damage is 2.5

but the bonus protection is .5
i assume the total bonus damage would be 2.5 * bonus damage protection)

then subtract from that.
in this case, would be 1.25

if bonus damage protection is 1, then no bonus protection no matter what.
maybe that makes the most sense.

i would propose having a function that returns the total bonus damage.


starts with siege means its artillery.
