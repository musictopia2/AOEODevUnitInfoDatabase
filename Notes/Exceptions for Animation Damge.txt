Looks like there are some exceptions for calculations for the dpa.

Well see what they are and then i can see how to handle in the new system.

one is immortals.

for that, the first 2 are the hand the the other 2 are the ranged portions.

well see what the other exceptions are.


the units that has charge has another exception.

because of the charge.
so woad raiders and lancers (only champions) have a charge animation (only on the first hit) it's animation 3 for those where the dps is also multiplied, *3 for woads, 2.75 for lancers champion

would probably need another field for charge.
that if used, then would consider.  if not, then will not have that exception.


good news is since road and lancers are champion and we are not doing that yet,
then don't have to worry about that portion yet.


for egy and greek villager and later romans  anim 1 2 and 3 are melee attack animation to buildings only, animation 4 and 5 are melee attack animation to units only, animations 6 7 8 are animation with range damage (huntables only)


for all other villagers ( babylonian celtic norse and persian) animation 1 and 2 is melee attack animation to unit only, animation 3 is meleee attack animation to buildings, animation 4 and 5 are animations for range damage (huntables only)


to test the exceptions, would need to test with villagers.

then with immortals.


as copied.


this means the part that does it will need to consider other things.
