The most important part of this phase is bonus damage.

Also armor.

Step 1 is bonus damage.

there are the following types:

"Damagebonusabstractinfantry": "2.00",
    "Damagebonusabstractarcher": "1.00",
    "Damagebonusabstractcavalry": "1.00",
    "Damagebonusbuilding": "2.50",
    "Damagebonusship": "1.00",
    "Damagebonusabstractartillery": "1.00",
    "Damagebonusabstractpriest": "1.00",
    "Damagebonusunittypevillager1": "1.00",
    "Damagebonusgr_cav_sarissophoroi": "1.00",
    "Damagebonushuntable": "1.00",
    "Damagebonusunittypebldgstorehouse": "1.00",

this is what the attacker does.

for ship, if tag is "Ship" then use ship bonus damage.

the bonus damage depends on who the target is.


for sais, if the attacker does bonus damage against it,
then consider no other bonus damages.

if storehouse, then that overrides all others.

if the attacker does bonus damage against storehouses, then would not consider anything else.


for building if tag contains the words building, then we can do that.
